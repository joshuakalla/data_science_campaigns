The treatment group was included in the regular program of the organization, which consists of two forms of contact. Most were called by a field organizer or volunteer and, if contacted, encouraged by phone to enroll in health insurance. Additionally, if an individual was subscribed to the email list they also received several emails a week encouraging them to enroll in health insurance. \n",

    "The most important outcome is whether an individual said they currently have health insurance when surveyed by phone 2 weeks after the end of the experiment. The results to the follow-up survey are in columns Q1 through Q15. Using the dataset, test whether the outreach efforts had any causal effect on insurance status in the treatment group. Is the insurance rate greater in the treatment group than in the control group? Is this difference statistically significant? Remember to use permutation tests, like in Lab 6, Questions 5 and 6. (Hint! You should also review this chapter you read for Lab 6: https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html. Note that this code uses the `datascience` library in Python, while we instead need to use `pandas` and `NumPy`. You will need to make some changes to the code from this textbook in order to get it to run for you.)\n",
