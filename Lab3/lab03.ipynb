    "*Hint 2:* `%` can be used on arrays, operating elementwise like `+` or `*`.  So `make_array(5, 6, 7) % 2` is `array([1, 0, 1])`.\n",

    "*Hint 3:* Create a column called \"Year_Remainder\" that's the remainder when each person's year of birth is divided by 2. Then create a new column called \"Even_Year\" that is set to 1 if \"Year_Remainder\" is 0 and is set to 0 if \"Year_Remainder\" is not 0. Remember `np.where` from above."
